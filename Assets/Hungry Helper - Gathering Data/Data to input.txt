-> ingredients
3 to 5 pounds bone-in meat, any kind
12 cups water
1 onion, whole
5 garlic cloves (optional)
2 celery stalks, whole
salt, as needed
5 black peppercorns, whole
2 bay leaves
2 carrots, peeled, whole
2 parsnips, peeled, whole (optional, to add an earthy flavor)

-> Steps
1. In a large (12 to 16-quart) stockpot over medium-high heat, brown the meat on all sides. Add the water
and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to low and allow to slowly simmer for
2 to 3 hours.
2. Remove from the heat, allow to cool, and refrigerate overnight.
3. Remove the fat that has solidified at the top. Remove the vegetables and strain the stock through a
cheesecloth-lined colander.
4. Remove the meat from the stock. Heat the stock over medium-high heat until it just begins to boil.
5. Fill sterilized jars with the stock, leaving 1 inch of headspace. Remove any air bubbles by inserting a knife
and moving it around the jar in an up-and-down motion. Wipe the rims clean with a moistened paper
towel, add the lids, and screw on the bands.
6. Following the manufacturerâ€™s directions, pressure-can the filled jars for 90 minutes at 10 pounds of
pressure. After 90 minutes, turn off heat and allow the pressure to drop to zero naturally.
